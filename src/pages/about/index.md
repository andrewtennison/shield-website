## Hero support

**Who we are**

Hero Support is a pop-up citizens procurement service, founded by professionals from many sectors, working on a pro bono basis to supply high-grade PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), both crowdfunded and donated, to frontline healthcare NHS and care staff. The PPE is sourced from vetted suppliers, within a volatile and complex environment. We have warehousing, and a dispatch team redeployed from the British festival circuit, and are partnering with the Doctors Association UK, which is collecting data on PPE needs from certified doctors.

As part of our focus on resilience through innovation, we have recruited medical device and innovation experts to barrier-bust collaborative solutions. We are founder members of SHIELD (Sustainable Hubs for Emergent Local Development) which brings together industry leaders with the aim of expediting solutions to the health crisis, working with the assistance of notified bodies such as the British Standards Institute (BSI), to ensure goods produced on novel supply lines are approved for use in contagious environments and in this time of crisis.

Who from HS participates in SHIELD:

* Dr Kate Hammer
* Mike McEwan
* Dr Alisa Pearlstone (pending)

**What we say about SHIELD**

“As a volunteer citizens’ procurement service set up by professionals, our aim is to build innovative and effective solutions in crisis. With Shield as an umbrella organisation, that remit will be facilitated,” Hero Support Project Director Dr Alisa Pearlstone explains.

“Within SHIELD we are collaborating to develop responsive supply streams for gowns, visors, ventilator consumables and other mission-critical medical devices,” adds Dr Kate Hammer, an innovation specialist who leads on Hero Support partnerships. “We’re actively pulling in our industry contacts, from textiles to technology.”

## Med Supply Drive UK

**Who are we?**

We are an organisation led by volunteer NHS doctors and medical students who are responding to the appeals of frontline healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 crisis without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff are telling us everyday that they desperately need more PPE to remain safe. A lack of PPE results in healthcare workers risking their own and their patients’ lives. Our aim is to coordinate the supply of PPE to NHS frontline staff and other healthcare settings. We want to protect our NHS workers and we need your help!

**What have we already achieved?**

In less than three weeks, we have already matched over 26,000 items of donated PPE to more than 60 different NHS healthcare facilities, including hospitals, GPs and community mental health clinics (up to date information as of 12.04.20). Because of our efforts, GPs have been able to stay open and doctors have been able to feel safer at work. We have recruited and trained more than 160 volunteers and processed donations from more than 200 individuals, businesses, schools and universities. However, the number of PPE requests is still four times higher than the number of donations we are getting so we need more help - your help - to continue protecting NHS staff.

## **Heroes**

**What is our purpose?**

In response to the growing pressure on the NHS frontline of the COVID-19 crisis, family and friends of a London-based NHS doctor, Dr Dominic Pimenta, came together to create HEROES; a new organisation to take care of the heroes taking care of us.

Founded by NHS workers to help NHS workers, HEROES brings direct insight from the frontline on the physical, mental and day to day needs of staff across the nation enabling delivery with immediacy and impact.

## The industry prints

The Industry Prints is encouraging and co-ordinating architects, engineers and construction consultants across the country to actively print 3D visors for frontline staff whilst collaborating with other industry experts to help lead a coordinated printing effort to protect our NHS heroes.

As a multi-disciplinary architecture & design practice, HTA Design brings together a wide range of specialisms focussed on people and places, communication and making. We know the power of collaboration and the difference that can be made when people work together, so in such extraordinary times it was important for us to work with the industry to help deliver a solution and rally those around us to do the same.
