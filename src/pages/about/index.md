## Hero support

**Who we are**

Hero Support is a pop-up citizens procurement service, founded by professionals from many sectors, working on a pro bono basis to supply high-grade PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), both crowdfunded and donated, to frontline healthcare NHS and care staff. The PPE is sourced from vetted suppliers, within a volatile and complex environment. We have warehousing, and a dispatch team redeployed from the British festival circuit, and are partnering with the Doctors Association UK, which is collecting data on PPE needs from certified doctors.

As part of our focus on resilience through innovation, we have recruited medical device and innovation experts to barrier-bust collaborative solutions. We are founder members of SHIELD (Sustainable Hubs for Emergent Local Development) which brings together industry leaders with the aim of expediting solutions to the health crisis, working with the assistance of notified bodies such as the British Standards Institute (BSI), to ensure goods produced on novel supply lines are approved for use in contagious environments and in this time of crisis.

Who from HS participates in SHIELD:

* Dr Kate Hammer
* Mike McEwan
* Dr Alisa Pearlstone (pending)

**What we say about SHIELD**

“As a volunteer citizens’ procurement service set up by professionals, our aim is to build innovative and effective solutions in crisis. With Shield as an umbrella organisation, that remit will be facilitated,” Hero Support Project Director Dr Alisa Pearlstone explains.

“Within SHIELD we are collaborating to develop responsive supply streams for gowns, visors, ventilator consumables and other mission-critical medical devices,” adds Dr Kate Hammer, an innovation specialist who leads on Hero Support partnerships. “We’re actively pulling in our industry contacts, from textiles to technology.”
