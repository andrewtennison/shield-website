## Med Supply Drive UK

**Who are we?**

We are an organisation led by volunteer NHS doctors and medical students who are responding to the appeals of frontline healthcare workers facing the COVID-19 crisis without adequate personal protective equipment (PPE). Doctors, nurses and other healthcare staff are telling us everyday that they desperately need more PPE to remain safe. A lack of PPE results in healthcare workers risking their own and their patients’ lives. Our aim is to coordinate the supply of PPE to NHS frontline staff and other healthcare settings. We want to protect our NHS workers and we need your help!

**What have we already achieved?**

In less than three weeks, we have already matched over 26,000 items of donated PPE to more than 60 different NHS healthcare facilities, including hospitals, GPs and community mental health clinics (up to date information as of 12.04.20). Because of our efforts, GPs have been able to stay open and doctors have been able to feel safer at work. We have recruited and trained more than 160 volunteers and processed donations from more than 200 individuals, businesses, schools and universities. However, the number of PPE requests is still four times higher than the number of donations we are getting so we need more help - your help - to continue protecting NHS staff.

## **Heroes**

**What is our purpose?**

In response to the growing pressure on the NHS frontline of the COVID-19 crisis, family and friends of a London-based NHS doctor, Dr Dominic Pimenta, came together to create HEROES; a new organisation to take care of the heroes taking care of us.

Founded by NHS workers to help NHS workers, HEROES brings direct insight from the frontline on the physical, mental and day to day needs of staff across the nation enabling delivery with immediacy and impact.

## Hero support

**Who we are**

Hero Support is a pop-up citizens procurement service, founded by professionals from many sectors, working on a pro bono basis to supply high-grade PPE (Personal Protective Equipment), both crowdfunded and donated, to frontline healthcare NHS and care staff. The PPE is sourced from vetted suppliers, within a volatile and complex environment. We have warehousing, and a dispatch team redeployed from the British festival circuit, and are partnering with the Doctors Association UK, which is collecting data on PPE needs from certified doctors.

As part of our focus on resilience through innovation, we have recruited medical device and innovation experts to barrier-bust collaborative solutions. We are founder members of SHIELD (Sustainable Hubs for Emergent Local Development) which brings together industry leaders with the aim of expediting solutions to the health crisis, working with the assistance of notified bodies such as the British Standards Institute (BSI), to ensure goods produced on novel supply lines are approved for use in contagious environments and in this time of crisis.

Who from HS participates in SHIELD:

* Dr Kate Hammer
* Mike McEwan
* Dr Alisa Pearlstone (pending)

**What we say about SHIELD**

“As a volunteer citizens’ procurement service set up by professionals, our aim is to build innovative and effective solutions in crisis. With Shield as an umbrella organisation, that remit will be facilitated,” Hero Support Project Director Dr Alisa Pearlstone explains.

“Within SHIELD we are collaborating to develop responsive supply streams for gowns, visors, ventilator consumables and other mission-critical medical devices,” adds Dr Kate Hammer, an innovation specialist who leads on Hero Support partnerships. “We’re actively pulling in our industry contacts, from textiles to technology.”

## Makerversity

Makerversitywas launched in 2013, with the support of Somerset House, born out of a desire to support emerging talent, frustration about limited space for creators and the lack of opportunities for young people to get excited about careers in emergent industries. Makerversity has since grown into a vibrant, pioneering curated membership community, comprising hundreds of creative and technology entrepreneurial businesses working at the cutting edge of product design, the internet of things, architecture, software development, digital manufacturing, creative technology and toolmaking, as well as fashion, furniture and many more disciplines. Somerset House have been a key supporter of Makerversity since it began, enabling it to operate an affordable workspace for the most exciting emerging creative-tech businesses in the heart of Central London. Makerversity is now the largest resident of Somerset House Studios, a major cross-disciplinary workspace championing collaboration and experimentation. Makerversity works together with Somerset House across programming and support activities, exploring new ways of developing changing creative practices.

## The National 3D Printing Society

The National 3D Printing Society is a network originally built by three university students from Huddersfield University and Cambridge University. They started by establishing their own successful societies within their own universities and then they assisted in helping their fellow academic peers from various subjects gain access to technology that would assist in bringing their ideas to reality, promoting innovative thinking within a variety of fields and industries. They both provided and gained knowledge that helped them with the creation of a network that will assist the adoption and growth of 3D Printing technology, by providing experiences to promote collaborations. The N3DPS seeks to ensure graduates have access to, and knowledge of Additive Manufacturing (AM).N3DPS refocused its volunteers to make face shields to assist with the PPE shortage.

## Do Some Good

The Real Estate industry has always had people at its heart and this is an opportunity to come together as a community with the right resources to truly make a difference.

Our industry can play its part to ensure that frontline NHS workers have the support required to endure the fight against this virus. Healthcare personnel are working tirelessly, and the expectation is that the worst is yet to come. We can help lessen the burden by providing much needed supplies, beds, and support for healthcare staff.
